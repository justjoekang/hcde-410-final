# The following project details my experience using TextBlob to perform a natural language processing task (sentiment analysis) on a large set of data. 

# WARNING: The following set of data can be found in the references below. The file of data is NOT included in this folder because of the large size (it was not able to be pushed to Github). To run the code, please download the dataset and save it as 'tweets.csv', and the code should work properly.
