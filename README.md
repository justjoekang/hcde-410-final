# In this project, I hope to make interesting discoveries in regards to people's public sentiment regarding ChatGPT over the span of 3 months (January to March of 2023). Some potential questions that might be answered thruogh this project are: 1) Are ChatGPT-related tweets garnering more likes and retweets as time passes? 2) How many individual users are engaging with ChatGPT each week or month? 3) Are ChatGPT-related tweets becoming more positive or more negative as time passes?
